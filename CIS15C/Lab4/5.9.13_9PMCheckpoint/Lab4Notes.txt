
delete:
-Left of tree will all be the same letter (not completely sure)
-Don't have to print webaddress (might as well)


LookUp:
-When changing the name, have to find a way to re-sort it into the tree (because the name is the unique key)


add
-Currently the add BST function is returning success if added or failed if it can't allocate memory.
-Need third function to not add if duplicate
-Need to create more parameters to include the phone number and webaddress. Currently, the dataInPtr will just be the key (name)
-Need to pass it right into the _insert function so that it can be sorted

delete
-need to return data back to user and not free it or else it is gone forever and the user can't use it
-still need to delete node
